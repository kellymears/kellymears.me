There are many types of food made available to my cat. In an effort to avoid being meowed to death my wife and I
are constantly providing her an assortment of food options. At this moment she regularly partakes in:

- basic dry kibble
- wet food (prescription, because she vomits)
- freeze-dried raw chicken
- temptations (treats, but sometimes offered as a meal to be quite honest)
- churu (a tube of pur√©ed meat, which she absolutely loves)

Mostly, feeding her is a game of trying to guess what she wants to eat, providing it on a plate, and hoping that
it quells the meowing. Frequently, we get it wrong. There are only a couple exceptions to this procedure:

1. In the morning we always feed her dry kibble because she is most likely to puke in the A.M. The kibble seems to
reduce this but&mdash;more importantly&mdash;it makes it a lot less disgusting to clean when she does vomit.
2. We never feed her churus until later at night. This is mostly because we are gravely concerned that she will
begin meowing for churus incessantly, for all meals, if she gets a taste too early in the day.

Today, I struggled with her. It was a worst case scenario. She rejected all foods. She wouldn't even go for the
temptations, which is rare. I was eyeing the churu. She actually gave up and began bathing on the top tier of her
cat tree. In a last ditch effort I tried one more thing. I'm not even sure what it inspired it.

I got a separate bowl and poured half a Japanese cup of dry kibble (already refused) into it. Then, I brought that
bowl into a different room than the one she normally eats in. I passed by her resting in her tree, staring out her
favored window, and she looked towards me, sniffing the air. She hopped down and began following me. 

I placed the bowl down on the floor of our entryway (foyer? entryway.) and she was on it immediately. She tore into
it, actually, ravenously. I tip-toed away to not trigger her skittishness. Her chomping was immense. My satisfaction
was overwhelming.

But, that satisfaction couldn't last. It was replaced by a dawning, horrible realization. Somehow, the room she was
being served in had made the difference. So now, in addition to the careful orchestration of food types and timings,
I had to also, evidently, consider the location of her meals.

What a strange animal.
